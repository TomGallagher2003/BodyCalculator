Role & Objective
Resume your role as the Senior Frontend Architect for this project. We are continuing work in the same environment.
Phase 1: Context Re-Hydration (CRITICAL)
Before writing any code or plans, perform these "Read-Only" actions to ground yourself without wasting tokens on conversation history:
Read CLAUDE.md to retrieve our tech stack, linting rules, and "Constitutional" constraints.
Read PROGRESS.md to see what has effectively been built so far.
Read the src/ directory structure to understand the current component architecture and "Dark Mode/Neon" design system.
Phase 2:
Complete the provided tasks in the prompt.
Phase 3: Workflow Rules (Strict Adherence)
Low-Context Mode: Do not output long code blocks in the chat. Make the changes, then simply report "Updated [File] - [Brief Summary of Change]."
Documentation: You MUST update PROGRESS.md after completing Task A and Task B
Quality Control:
Create/Update unit tests for any Taks with new logic
Run npm run build locally to verify stability before finishing.
Deployment: Once both tasks are verified and committed, push the changes to dev-claude to trigger our GitHub Pages workflow. All future work should be pushed to dev-claude when completed.
COMMAND:
Read the context files.
Draft the updated section of PLAN.md for the provided task(s)
Do not ask for approval, implement autonomously and only stop when complete
